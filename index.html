      <h1>(Lord Vishnu for Now) Bhagavad Gita "song of God"</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Krishna.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Krishna">

      <p>I will to thee unfold
        Some portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold!
        I am the Spirit seated deep in every creature's heart;
        From Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart!
        Vishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light;
        Maritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight;
        By day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon;
        By Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon!
        Of Vedas I am Sama-Ved, of gods in Indra's Heaven Vasava;</p>

      <p>of the faculties to living beings given
        The mind which apprehends and thinks; of Rudras Sankara;
        Of Yakshas and of Rakshasas, Vittesh; and Pavaka
        Of Vasus, and of mountain-peaks Meru; Vrihaspati
        Know Me 'mid planetary Powers; 'mid Warriors heavenly Skanda; 
        of all the water-floods the Sea which drinketh each,</p>

      <p>And Bhrigu of the holy Saints, and OM of sacred speech;
        Of prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills Himala's snow,
        And Aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow;
        Of the Devarshis, Narada; and Chitrarath of them
        That sing in Heaven, and Kapila of Munis, and the gem
        Of flying steeds, Uchchaisravas, from Amrit-wave which burst;
        Of elephants Airavata; of males the Best and First;</p>
